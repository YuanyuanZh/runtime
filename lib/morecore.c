Useful resource has been Doug Lea's malloc(): http://g.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc-2.6.6.c

This uses UNIX mmap() to get more core from the OS. It's not portable. E.g., A comment for Windows,
support says to use CreateFile():

	https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366556(v=vs.85).aspx

Doug Lea's allocator has a wsbrk() function to emulate UNIX sbrk(), which could be a better
way.
